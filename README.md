# Web-Development-Projects
 A repo containing projects on Html5, Css and Javascript
First HtmlProject contains html5 elements.
The index.html is full project I created about my personal website. Where I linked two extra pages leading to the About Me and Contaxt Me pages. 
I understood how to link files as well.
One trick I learned - to generate the html boilerplate just type ! then enter. Voila it comes up on your vscode.
Some elements here includes: 
<p></p> - for paragraphs
<ul></ul>- for unordered list 
<ol></ol> - for ordered list
<li></li> - for creating the list 
<img src>- for adding images
<a></a> - anchor tags 
<a href></a>- for hyperlinking any link to the Words inbetween the anchor tags.
Thank You.

# HTML-Portfolio
The HtmlProject contains a website built using html5 elements.
The index.html is full project I created about my personal website. Where I linked two extra pages leading to the About Me and Contaxt Me pages. 
I understood how to link files as well.
One trick I learned - to generate the html boilerplate just type ! then enter. Voila it comes up on your vscode.
Some elements here includes: 
p tags - for paragraphs
<ul></ul>- for unordered list - ul tag
<ol></ol> - for ordered list - ol tag
<li></li> - for creating the list - li tag
<imgsrc>- for adding images- img src tag
<a></a> - anchor tags - a tag
<ahref></a>- for hyperlinking any link to the Words inbetween the anchor tags.- a href tag
Thank You.

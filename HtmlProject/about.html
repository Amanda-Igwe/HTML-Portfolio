    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>You might be wondering but this is me practising my html5 skills
        using this medium and I hope it comes out fine. <br>
        Coding has become a fun thing for me to do in recent times and I am 
        beginning to find it relaxing. I know this is weird or maybe familiar
        to someone out there.I dunno lool. <br>Well back to my story
        I have been learning lots of skills and this is infact a  new 
        way of learning.Creating a project while I study and hoping
        to keep being consistent.</p>
